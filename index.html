Which may exist up to or more than terabytes and petabytes.\n\nVelocity: Velocity basically introduces the pace at which data is being produced in real-time. To give a simple example for recognition, imagine the rate at which Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter posts are generated per second, an hour or more.\n\nVariety:  Big Data comprises structured, unstructured, and semi-structured data collected from varied sources. This different variety of data requires very different and specific analyzing and processing techniques with unique and appropriate algorithms.\n\nVeracity: Data veracity basically relates to how reliable the data is, or in a fundamental way, we can define it as the quality of the data analyzed.\n\nValue: Raw data is of no use or meaning but once converted into something valuable. We can extract helpful information.\n\n") }

Companies are frequently using big data to gain a competing edge over business rivals.\n\nChecking the datasets a company collects is just one part of the big data process. Big data professionals also need to know what the company requires from the application and how they plan to use the data to their advantage.\n\nConfident decision-building: Analytics aims to develop decision building, and big data endures to sustain this. Big data can help enterprises speed up their decision-making method with so much data available while still being assured of their choice. Nowadays, moving fast and reacting to broader trends and operational changes is a huge business benefit in a quick-paced society.\n\nAsset optimisation: Big data signifies that businesses can control assets at a personal level. This implies they can adequately optimise assets depending on the data source, improve productivity, extend the lifespan of help, and reduce the downtime some assets may require. This gives a competing advantage by assuring the company is getting the most out of its assets and links with decreasing costs.\n\nCost reduction: Big data can support businesses to reduce their outgoings. From analysing energy usage to assessing the effectiveness of staff operating patterns, data collected by companies can help them recognise where they can make cost savings without having a negative impact on company operations.\n\nImprove customer engagement: When surveying online, consumers make confident choices indicating their decisions, habits, and tendencies that can then be used to develop and tailor consumer dialogue, which could then be interpreted into increased sales. Understanding what each client is looking for through the data collected on them means you can target them with specific products, but it also gives a personal feel that many consumers today have come to await.\n\nIdentify new revenue streams: Analytics can further assist companies in identifying new revenue streams and expanding into other areas. For example, knowing customer trends and decisions allow firms to decide the way they should go. The data companies accumulate can also likely be sold, adding income streams and the potential to build alliances with other businesses.\n\n") }
